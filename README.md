While interning at MeriSKILL, I embarked on a fascinating journey through data analysis, focusing on sales data to drive impactful business decisions. 📊💡

🔍 Purpose:
My mission was to unravel the hidden gems within a vast sales dataset, revealing crucial insights such as trends, top-selling products, and revenue metrics that would guide strategic choices for the company.

📋 Description:
I meticulously combed through extensive data, unearthing valuable nuggets of information. My analysis encompassed a wide range of tasks, from tracking sales trends over time to identifying the best-selling products. I also calculated essential revenue metrics, including total sales and profit margins, while crafting captivating visualizations to make the data come alive. This project not only showcases my prowess in handling extensive datasets but also my knack for deriving actionable insights that empower data-driven recommendations for optimizing sales strategies. 📊✨

🛠 Tools Used:
To achieve these remarkable results, I harnessed the power of Microsoft Excel for data manipulation and cleaning, as well as Power BI for its DAX functions, Power Query, and exceptional data visualization capabilities.

📂 Data Source:
The dataset, generously provided by MeriSKILL, was initially a single sheet. Employing SQL normalization techniques, I transformed it into five separate sheets: "Sales Data," "Month," "City," "State," and "Country." This structuring method allowed for a more organized and comprehensive view of sales metrics across various categories. 🧰📊

🧹 Data Cleaning Process:
The data cleaning process involved meticulous organization, ensuring that data was efficiently sorted into different sheets. The introduction of "State" and "Country" columns provided invaluable links between these sheets, offering a holistic perspective on sales metrics. 📂🔍
